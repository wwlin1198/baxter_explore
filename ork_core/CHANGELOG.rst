------------------
* Properly install test macros
  This fixes `#33 <https://github.com/wg-perception/object_recognition_core/issues/33>`_
* Don't throw when database is empty
  There is no need to throw here.
  The function load_fields_and_attachments works quite nicely
  for an empty database. The only thing it has to do is return...
  This makes it possible to use the rviz plugin OrkObject without
  a valid database (This obviously doesn't show meshes or the name then,
  but it's still useful as it prints confidence values and the object's key.
