object_recognition_capture: Data Capture
########################################

.. contents::

Capturing data about an object to perform object recognition requires the following:
    * knowing where the camera is with respect to a constant world frame
    * knowing where the object is in the captured images/scans
    * getting enough views to cover all aspects of an object

The third point depends on what is done with the captured data (e.g. computing a mesh a 3d model, templates ...) and is
done by only requiring a given number of views.

The first point is currently done with a textured pattern (a dot pattern or a custom one) and is described in the Setup_
section.

The second point is currently done by segmenting out whatever is on top of the plane formed by the pattern.

``capture`` uses the database infrastructure provided by ``object_recognition_core`` and ``object_recognition_capture``
to store the captured data.

3d Camera
*********

    :arg2: ROS

.. toggle:: Non-ROS

    Start your 3d sensor (Kinect, ASUS ...)

.. toggle:: ROS

    The standard openni drivers are used (not the ROS topics), so you just need to plug in your 3d camera.

Setup
*****
Capture is view based, and requires a fiducial that is rigidly attached to the object being observed.  This enables
relatively accurate view point pose estimation, a consistent object coordinate frame, and simple object/background
segmentation. The setup assumes that you have an RGB Depth device, such as the Kinect.

We have two methods of object captures, that have roughly equivalent quality results: a dot pattern and a generic
pattern (which is useful if you cannot print the dot pattern)


.. rubric:: Dot Pattern

.. _capture_board:

One type of fiducial usable by object capture is the dot pattern. An svg is available here
:download:`capture_board_big_5x3.svg` and a pdf for printing here :download:`capture_board_big_5x3.svg.pdf`.

.. figure:: capture_board_big_5x3.svg.png

The dot pattern has two sets of fiducial markers: one black on white, the other inverted, so that two may be detected
in the scene and allow for pose estimation in the presence of occlusion of one of the markers.

Get a full size printing of the above fiducial marker and mount it to flat surface, possibly on a lazy susan.

**IMPORTANT:** the physical size of the pattern actually does not matter as it is found in 2d and the proper scale is
figured out using a Kinect-based plane finder.

.. rubric:: ORB Template

.. _orb_template:

.. figure:: orb_template.jpg
   
If you are not inclined to print the dot pattern, you may use any highly textured planar surface. This involves
capturing a canonical view of said surface to later establish an object coordinate system, and perform
segmentation.

First capture an ORB template of your capture workspace. It should be taken from a planar frontal view, and the center
of the image should be filled by the plane. Press 's' to save an image. The result will be placed in the directory
given, e.g. my_textured_plane. Press 'q' to quit the template capture program.

.. toggle_table::
    :arg1: Non-ROS
    :arg2: ROS

.. toggle:: Non-ROS

    .. code-block:: sh

        ./apps/orb_template -o my_textured_plane

.. toggle:: ROS

    .. code-block:: sh

        rosrun object_recognition_capture orb_template -o my_textured_plane

Try out tracking to see if you got a good template. Press 'q' to quit.

.. toggle_table::

    .. code-block:: sh

        ./apps/orb_track --track_directory my_textured_plane

        rosrun object_recognition_capture orb_track --track_directory my_textured_plane

capture
*******

``capture`` is the entry point for using the our object capture system. The capture program will estimate a pose per
view, along with a depth based mask. This will result in a ROS bag of data that has the following topics::

   types:       geometry_msgs/PoseStamped [d3812c3cbc69362b77dc0b19b345f8f5]
                sensor_msgs/CameraInfo    [c9a58c1b0b154e0e6da7578cb991d214]
                sensor_msgs/Image         [060021388200f6f0f447d0fcd9c64743]
   topics:      /camera/depth/camera_info   72 msgs    : sensor_msgs/CameraInfo   
                /camera/depth/image         72 msgs    : sensor_msgs/Image        
                /camera/mask                72 msgs    : sensor_msgs/Image        
                /camera/pose                72 msgs    : geometry_msgs/PoseStamped
                /camera/rgb/camera_info     72 msgs    : sensor_msgs/CameraInfo   
                /camera/rgb/image_color     72 msgs    : sensor_msgs/Image


To use ``capture`` you should place your object in the center of the fiducial board, and keep it in the same location
for the entirety of the capture session. Slowly turn the fiducial board, and the program should capture views that are
evenly distributed in a view pose sphere.

Run the capture program in preview mode and make sure the pose of the pattern is displayed and the mask of the object
non-empty (it should display the initial image by replacing anything but the object with black). The mask represents
everything that is in a cylinder centered at the pose object and with dimensions specified through the command line.
This is what clusters the object out and that is fed for training.

.. toggle_table::
    :arg1: Non-ROS
    :arg2: ROS

If you don't have a pattern and use the dot pattern, ommit the ``-i`` option below:

.. toggle:: Non-ROS

    .. code-block:: sh

        ./apps/capture -i my_textured_plane --seg_z_min 0.01 -o silk.bag --preview

.. toggle:: ROS

    .. code-block:: sh

        rosrun object_recognition_capture capture -i my_textured_plane --seg_z_min 0.01 -o silk.bag --preview

You should see a popup image similar to the following:

.. figure:: capture.gif

   A sample sequence of view captured using an opposing dot pattern fudicial marker.

When satisified by the preview mode, run it for real.  The following will capture a bag of 60 views where each view is
normally distributed on the view sphere. The mask and pose displays should only refresh when a novel view is captured.
The program will finish when 36 (-n) views are captured. Press 'q' to quit early.

.. toggle_table::
    :arg1: Non-ROS
    :arg2: ROS

.. toggle:: Non-ROS

    .. code-block:: sh

        ./apps/capture -i my_textured_plane --seg_z_min 0.01 -o silk.bag

.. toggle:: ROS

    .. code-block:: sh

        rosrun object_recognition_capture capture -i my_textured_plane --seg_z_min 0.01 -o silk.bag

multiple capture sessions
=========================
If you decided to take multiple bags of an object, from different view points, please concatenate the bags before
upload. However, if you moved the object on the board, then you should consider these bags as seperate "sessions" of
the same object.

There is a convenience script for this called ``concat.py``

.. program-output:: ../../apps/bagscripts/concat.py --help
    :in_srcdir:

upload
******
Once you have captured a bag of views, you will want to upload the bag to the database.  This upload will contain all of
the views in the bag, plus some meta information about the object. It assumed that each bag has one object, and this
object has a consistent coordinate frame throughout the bag.

use
===
A typical command line session will look like:

.. toggle_table::
   :arg1: Non-ROS
   :arg2: ROS

.. toggle:: Non-ROS

   .. code-block:: sh
     
      % apps/upload -a 'Ethan Rublee' -e 'erublee@willowgarage.com' -i silk.bag -n 'silk' -d 'A carton of Silk brand soy milk.' --commit milk, soy, kitchen, tod
      Uploaded session with id: 4ad9f2d3db57bbd414e5e987773490a0

.. toggle:: ROS

   .. code-block:: sh

      % rosrun object_recognition_capture upload -a 'Ethan Rublee' -e 'erublee@willowgarage.com' -i silk.bag -n 'silk' -d 'A carton of Silk brand soy milk.' --commit milk, soy, kitchen, tod
      Uploaded session with id: 4ad9f2d3db57bbd414e5e987773490a0

If you leave off the ``--commit`` the script will run without actually committing anything to the database.

Now that the bag is uploaded, into the database, you can see it in the db by browsing to:

* http://localhost:5984/_utils/database.html?object_recognition/_design/objects/_view/by_object_name

Willow users
============
Some pre-acquired bags exist internally for now, just rsync them:

.. code-block:: sh

    rsync -vPa /wg/wgss0_shelf1/object_recognition_capture ./
